# MLAB2_summary
Collection of coding assignments from MLAB. These were initially completed in pair programming with other MLAB participants over three weeks in August 2022. Some material has been removed to keep it private.

w1d2: Built convolutional neural networks from scratch using as_strided. Trained a Resnet on cifar10.

w1d3: Built the backpropagation function in pytorch from class. Created a new Tensor class based on numpy arrays and wrote all basic automatic differentiation functions. Then build our own Module class and Linear modules, as in pytorch. In the end we are able to train a fully connected network on MNIST.
